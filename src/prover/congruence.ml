    (* Asserts the following, in this order:
      - All constants appearing within fields of [cc] with the exception of
        [classlist] are class representants. A constant [c] is a class
        representant when [representatives[c]=c]. In particular, this implies
        that [representatives] is idempotent.
      - The entries of [unifiable], [constructor] and [classlist] that
        correspond to constants that are not representatives have default
        values.
      - All lists are actually representing sets, so they must have no repeats.
        In addition, they are strictly increasing. (TODO: Change the data type
        to [Set]?)
      - Pairs in [not_equal] are strictly increasing.
      - The [uselist] contains exactly the aparitions in [lookup] and
        [not_equal].
      - The [rev_lookup] is the reverse of [lookup].
      - The [rev_lookup] contains no repeats of the first component, if it is a
        constructor.
      - The [classlist] is the reverse of [representatives].
      - Closure under propagation of disequalities:
        - If (a, b)âˆŠnot_equal, f constructor, and {f(a)=c, f(b)=d}âŠ†lookup,
          then (c, d)âˆŠnot_equal.
        - If {f(a)=c, f(b)=d}âˆŠlookup and (c,d)âˆŠnot_equal,
          then (a,b)âˆŠnot_equal
      - If f and g are constructors and rep(f)!=rep(g), then (f,g)âˆŠnot_equal.
        (NOTE&TODO: This is currently *not* true, but simulated by [rep_uneq].
        It may be less risky and not much slower to explicitly use [not_equal].)

    NOTE: The checks above imply closure under propagation of equalities:
      - (a=b --> f(a)=f(b)) because there are only reps in [lookup]
      - (f cons --> f(a)=f(b) --> a=b)
        because [rev_lookup] doesn't repeat constructors
