(* By definition a sequent holds when ((h * f) -> (c * f)) is a valid formula.
NOTE: Any free variable is interpreted as a free variable in the above formula.
For example, if x is free in some of h, f, c, then the sequent is valid when
âˆ€x((h * f) -> (c * f)), because a formula is valid when its closure is valid. *)

The subgoal list represents a conjunction.  The goal often has the form (L*?l |-
R*?r): L and R contain the interesting part, while the pattern variables ?l and
?r capture the rest.
