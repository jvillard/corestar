- fill in TODOs

- fix bug in treatment of constructors for frame inference:
  constants (aka constructors) from the obligation should be assumed
  distinct from the other constructors that appear in the assumption
- kill existentials that are not in a given set
- simplify triples by killing existentials that don't appear in both pre&post
- use modifies clauses in symexec
  - to infer them, make sure they only shrink
  - if modifies=None, then over-approximate
