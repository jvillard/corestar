- use Z3 to help with instantiating lvars that occur only in conclusion
- change syntax for named parameters
- make it faster
- test on problem similar to those of topstar
- disjunctions in preconditions should probably lead to splitting the triple
- do some sensible checking for the "instantiations" claimed while checking
  (this is a soundness problem!)
- proper treatement of global variables
- add 'where' sidecondition (instantiate with matching)
- apply (equivalence) rewrite rules on side-conditions
- port old tests
- mechanism to specify calculus rules order
- add location to AST elements (CFG/rules/...)
