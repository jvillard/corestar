- fill in TODOs
  - fill in TODOs in symexec
  - z3/smt2 small interface
  - code that applies user rules for prover
  - add 'where' sidecondition (instantiate with matching)
  - apply (equivalence) rewrite rules on side-conditions
  - try jstar tests and look at the errors (NikosG: are they comming from the parser)
  - port old tests
  - add types to expressions (useful for talking to Z3)
  - avoid using [mk_app] if there exists an alternative constructor

- old todos, just for reference:
  - fix bug in treatment of constructors for frame inference:
    constants (aka constructors) from the obligation should be assumed
    distinct from the other constructors that appear in the assumption
  - kill existentials that are not in a given set
  - simplify triples by killing existentials that don't appear in both pre&post
  - use modifies clauses in symexec
    - to infer them, make sure they only shrink
    - if modifies=None, then over-approximate
