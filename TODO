- fill in TODOs
  - pretty-print expressions
  - hash-consing for expressions (ask Nikos T?)
  - port old tests
  - remove the -nosmt flag, as smt is essential in this version

- old todos, just for reference:
  - fix bug in treatment of constructors for frame inference:
    constants (aka constructors) from the obligation should be assumed
    distinct from the other constructors that appear in the assumption
  - kill existentials that are not in a given set
  - simplify triples by killing existentials that don't appear in both pre&post
  - use modifies clauses in symexec
    - to infer them, make sure they only shrink
    - if modifies=None, then over-approximate
