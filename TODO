- use Z3 to help with instantiating lvars that occur only in conclusion
- change syntax for named parameters
- make it faster
- remove the exponential complexity in find_matches
  this could possibly involve reverting to the old behaviour of
  implicitly framing sequents in user rules
  See https://github.com/seplogic/corestar/commit/ab372af2b10f0a4aff4b7213b00dc24af3707b64
- don't check if formulas are inconsistent after each symbolic execution step
  (trying to prove f |- false is very expensive since we have to
  exhaust all options. find something lighter-weight to do)
- test on problem similar to those of topstar
- disjunctions in preconditions should probably lead to splitting the triple
- do some sensible checking for the "instantiations" claimed while checking
  (this is a soundness problem!)
- proper treatement of global variables
- add 'where' sidecondition (instantiate with matching)
- apply (equivalence) rewrite rules on side-conditions
- port old tests
- mechanism to specify calculus rules order
- add location to AST elements (CFG/rules/...)
