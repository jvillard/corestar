- use Z3 to help with instantiating lvars that occur only in conclusion
- change syntax for named parameters
- make it faster
- check that the number of arguments of functions/specs match
  otherwise Z3 will throw an exception later and that's ugly
- test on problem similar to those of topstar
- disjunctions in preconditions should probably lead to splitting the triple
- do some sensible checking for the "instantiations" claimed while checking
  (this is a soundness problem!)
- proper treatement of global variables
- add 'where' sidecondition (instantiate with matching)
- apply (equivalence) rewrite rules on side-conditions
- port old tests
