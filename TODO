- source of List.rev
- do some sensible checking for the "instantiations" claimed while checking
- add prover rule that drops spatial part in hypothesis if conclusion is pure
  (should also lead to a better inconsistency check)
- test on problem similar to those of topstar
- check out what do tests do
- split on || in postcondition makes corestar forget
  a bit too much how to compute a pvar in term of the initial state
- proper treatement of global variables
- scoping for variables in expression; that is, quantifiers
- add types to expressions (useful for talking to Z3)
- add polymorphic sorts (equality, bvadd, bvconcat, etc)
- sort checking for expressions (at build time)
- add 'where' sidecondition (instantiate with matching)
- apply (equivalence) rewrite rules on side-conditions
- port old tests
- avoid using [mk_app] if there exists an alternative constructor

- old todos, just for reference:
  - fix bug in treatment of constructors for frame inference:
    constants (aka constructors) from the obligation should be assumed
    distinct from the other constructors that appear in the assumption
  - kill existentials that are not in a given set
  - simplify triples by killing existentials that don't appear in both pre&post
  - use modifies clauses in symexec
    - to infer them, make sure they only shrink
    - if modifies=None, then over-approximate
